# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Objective
The goal is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Background

6 files separated by commas are provided with the information that will allow determining the data that the company needs. As a first step, 6 tables are created in PGAdmin to import those files and make it easier to manipulate the information. A relationship diagram is created from the generated tables, which is shown in the following image.

## Analysis

By manipulating the initial information and creating new tables, they realize that Pewlet-Hackard has a great challenge, since a significant number of staff are about to retire. The challenges it faces are many, because the knowledge of the company, the processes and the experience of the eligible personnel will be taken with them at the time of their retirement. Although the challenge is great, whenever there is this type of change that is so significant for the company, it is time to reinvent itself and make reprocesses with the personnel that still lack time for their retirement and new personnel, which, always new ideas inject life to the business model.
